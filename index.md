# About me


I am currently a <a href="https://cimes.princeton.edu/">CIMES Postdoctoral Research Associate</a> in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University. I have a broad interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_chemistry">environmental chemistry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry">geochemistry</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry">physical chemistry</a>. Specifically, I focus on interfacial phenomena. I am profoundly interested in understanding how these foundational sciences affect the environment, energy, and our climate. Currently, my research aims to <strong>bridge the gap between the nanoscale foundation of aerosol microphysics and its representation in GFDL climate models</strong>.    



I'm a PhD student in Princeton University's
[Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program](https://aos.princeton.edu/),
where I study and perform research in the realm of geophysical fluid dynamics
under the guidance of [Dr. Stephen Griffies](https://stephengriffies.github.io/).
My research focuses on ocean physics and ocean/climate modeling, with the overarching goal
of better physically understanding the oceans and being able to represent them
in numerical models of varying complexity.

I also have various [projects](https://mjclobo.github.io/projects/) which highlight my personal and professional interests.

## Outreach

I'm always looking for outreach opportunities, especially those that
are geared towards making STEM more accessible to people from underrepresented backgrounds.

I'm also interested in helping others make their way into the field of ocean sciences and STEM, more generally.
If you're looking for any advice on gaining research experience, applying to graduate school, or just want general
information, feel free to contact me.

See my [outreach page](https://mjclobo.github.io/outreach/) for more details.
